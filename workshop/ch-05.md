# Tired of running grunt every time you change something?
We can use a task that watches our changes and triggers the `grunt babel` task for us.
Lets install `$ npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-watch` and then create `tasks/watch.js`.
```js
module.exports = function (grunt) {
    var config = {
        watch: {
            ui: {
                files: [
                    'src/**/*.js'
                ],
                tasks: ['babel'],
                options: {
                    livereload: true
                }
            }
        }
    };

    grunt.config.merge(config);
};
```

# Connect and Watch ?
Now we have a task that watches our changes but we need it to work concurrently with the `connect` http server.
Lets install `$ npm install --save-dev grunt-concurrent` and create `tasks/concurrent.js`.
```js
module.exports = function (grunt) {
    var config = {
        concurrent: {
            dev: {
                tasks: ['connect:server:keepalive', 'watch'],
                options: {
                    logConcurrentOutput: true
                }
            }
        }
    };

    grunt.config.merge(config);
};
```

Now we can use `grunt concurrent` and it will run watch and connect simultaneously.
Something that we need to keep in mind is that the watch now is executing our transpiler,
such way our code will not get transpiled until we modify a file while having our `concurrent`
task running. Lets modify our `package.json` file.
```js
  "scripts": {
    "start": "grunt babel && grunt concurrent"
  },
```
Now we can type `$npm start` and it will transpile and start the concurrent tasks for us.

# Livereload
If you are curious, then for sure you did notice the `livereload: true` option on the `tasks/watch.js` task. Lets add the **Live Reload** script to our `public/index.html` file.
```html
<script src="//localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>
```
Now, refresh the browser (to update the html), then go and modify our `src/index.js` file and see what happen.
