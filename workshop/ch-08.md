# State
The state shall be used to store data that is only relevant to the component itself, for example consider a row selection, which rows are selected are not relevant to user properties or to any other component rendering the list of users.
# Initialize the State on the constructor
```js
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {};
}
```
We will make the row rendering function to be a `<UsersList />` component method in order to it to access the component state.
```js
userRow(user) {
    let selected = !!this.state[user.key];

    return (
        <tr key={user.key} className={selected ? 'info' : ''} onClick={e => this.rowClick(user)}>
            <td>{user.first}</td>
            <td>{user.last}</td>
            <td>{user.username}</td>
        </tr>
    );
}
```
As you can notice we will add a `class` attribute to render with some highlight the users that we have marked as selected. Next you can see a `onClick` event.
```js
rowClick(user) {
    let state = {};
    state[user.key] = !this.state[user.key];
    this.setState(state);
}
```
This is the method that will update the component state, once we update the state the Component will be rendered again displaying the change we have just made.
